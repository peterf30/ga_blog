<h1>Thoughts about being in Furlough</h1>
<p>First thing that comes to mind is that feeling of isolation and a loss of routine. usually there would be daily standup meetings to attend or backlog
    grooming meetings but once your furloughed you can't be apart of. There are
    coffee meetings and quizes to take away that feeling of isolation. My time has been spent going through sql commands in postgres and sql exercises also working on web development tasks, catchuup with friends/family and going to the gym.</p>
