One of my hobbies is to visit the gym twice to three times a week.
Some people will prefer to exercise at home often referred to as a
home workout. However I like to workout at the gym due to there
being a change of environment. It allows for me to just concentrate
on the task at hand without any thoughts bothering me. Everybody
is welcome to participate it doesn't judge you for who you are or 
what you may look like. There is also the fact everybody is constantly striving to be better and pushing themselves.
