Food shopping is something everybody has to do, I do this 
two to three times a week. I always make sure that there 
are combination of different fruits and salads. Personally 
these are must, having a healthy diet is important both physically
and mentally as well. I think a balanced diet helps keep one alert
day to day. There are number of articles on the internet out there about
the importance of incorporating fruits/salads into ones diet.
